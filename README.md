 ## Assignment 2: Metaheuristic local search

 To reproduce results, choose an experiment from `Assignment-2/experiments/` and place then in the `Assignment-2/` directory and run.

 Furthermore, the current results are obtained using a faulty Fiduccia Mattheyses algorithm. A correct implementation is also available in the `graph_correct.py` file as part of that version of `Graph` class, function `fiduccia_mattheyses()`.
